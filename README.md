## SS-Smart Subscriptions
“Smart Subscriptions” is a comprehensive subscription management platform designed to help users efficiently track and manage all their online and offline subscription services.
My app makes subscription management simple and intuitive by automatically syncing users' subscription information, charges, and renewal dates.

## Connected Environment
Implement geofencing technology to trigger notifications about subscription services when users enter a specific geographic area. For example, when they walk by a concert hall, they might receive a notification about a subscription for upcoming events.
Partner with local businesses to offer exclusive subscription deals when users are nearby, such as coffee shop loyalty programs or local gym trials.
